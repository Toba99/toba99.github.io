			<h2>Marketing</h2>
			<p>It all started with a tweet. In 2015, a Twitter user shared a picture of her savings box and she talked about how she saved NGN365,000 by putting aside N1,000 (Naira) everyday. This conversation then progressed into how to automate the piggy bank concept, as the original concept requires a substantial amount of discipline. In addition, the security and the safety of the box is not guaranteed. This is what inspired us to start the business and this is how Piggybank.ng was born – out of the cons list of a wooden box.</p>
